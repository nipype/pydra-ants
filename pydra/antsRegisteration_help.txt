COMMAND: 
     antsRegistration
          This program is a user-level registration application meant to utilize classes 
          in ITK v4.0 and later. The user can specify any number of "stages" where a stage 
          consists of a transform; an image metric; and iterations, shrink factors, and 
          smoothing sigmas for each level. Note that explicitly setting the 
          dimensionality, metric, transform, output, convergence, shrink-factors, and 
          smoothing-sigmas parameters is mandatory. 

OPTIONS: 
     --version 
          Get Version Information. 

     -d, --dimensionality 2/3/4
          This option forces the image to be treated as a specified-dimensional image. If 
          not specified, we try to infer the dimensionality from the input image. 

     -o, --output outputTransformPrefix
                  [outputTransformPrefix,<outputWarpedImage>,<outputInverseWarpedImage>]
          Specify the output transform prefix (output format is .nii.gz ). Optionally, one 
          can choose to warp the moving image to the fixed space and, if the inverse 
          transform exists, one can also output the warped fixed image. Note that only the 
          images specified in the first metric call are warped. Use antsApplyTransforms to 
          warp other images using the resultant transform(s). When a composite transform 
          is not specified, linear transforms are specified with a '.mat' suffix and 
          displacement fields with a 'Warp.nii.gz' suffix (and 'InverseWarp.nii.gz', when 
          applicable. In addition, for velocity-based transforms, the full velocity field 
          is written to file ('VelocityField.nii.gz') as long as the collapse transforms 
          flag is turned off ('-z 0'). 

     -j, --save-state saveStateAsTransform
          Specify the output file for the current state of the registration. The state 
          file is written to an hdf5 composite file. It is specially usefull if we want to 
          save the current state of a SyN registration to the disk, so we can load and 
          restore that later to continue the next registration process directly started 
          from the last saved state. The output file of this flag is the same as the 
          write-composite-transform, unless the last transform is a SyN transform. In that 
          case, the inverse displacement field of the SyN transform is also added to the 
          output composite transform. Again notice that this file cannot be treated as a 
          transform, and restore-state option must be used to load the written file by 
          this flag. 

     -k, --restore-state restoreStateAsATransform
          Specify the initial state of the registration which get immediately used to 
          directly initialize the registration process. The flag is mutually exclusive 
          with other intialization flags.If this flag is used, none of the 
          initial-moving-transform and initial-fixed-transform cannot be used. 

     -a, --write-composite-transform 1/(0)
          Boolean specifying whether or not the composite transform (and its inverse, if 
          it exists) should be written to an hdf5 composite file. This is false by default 
          so that only the transform for each stage is written to file. 
          <VALUES>: 0

     -p, --print-similarity-measure-interval <unsignedIntegerValue>
          Prints out the CC similarity metric measure between the full-size input fixed 
          and the transformed moving images at each iteration a value of 0 (the default) 
          indicates that the full scale computation should not take placeany value greater 
          than 0 represents the interval of full scale metric computation. 
          <VALUES>: 0

     --write-interval-volumes <unsignedIntegerValue>
          Writes out the output volume at each iteration. It helps to present the 
          registration process as a short movie a value of 0 (the default) indicates that 
          this option should not take placeany value greater than 0 represents the 
          interval between the iterations which outputs are written to the disk. 
          <VALUES>: 0

     -z, --collapse-output-transforms (1)/0
          Collapse output transforms. Specifically, enabling this option combines all 
          adjacent transforms wherepossible. All adjacent linear transforms are written to 
          disk in the forman itk affine transform (called xxxGenericAffine.mat). 
          Similarly, all adjacent displacement field transforms are combined when written 
          to disk (e.g. xxxWarp.nii.gz and xxxInverseWarp.nii.gz (if available)).Also, an 
          output composite transform including the collapsed transforms is written to the 
          disk (called outputCollapsed(Inverse)Composite). 
          <VALUES>: 1

     -i, --initialize-transforms-per-stage (1)/0
          Initialize linear transforms from the previous stage. By enabling this option, 
          the current linear stage transform is directly intialized from the previous 
          stage's linear transform; this allows multiple linear stages to be run where 
          each stage directly updates the estimated linear transform from the previous 
          stage. (e.g. Translation -> Rigid -> Affine). 
          <VALUES>: 0

     -n, --interpolation Linear
                         NearestNeighbor
                         MultiLabel[<sigma=imageSpacing>,<alpha=4.0>]
                         Gaussian[<sigma=imageSpacing>,<alpha=1.0>]
                         BSpline[<order=3>]
                         CosineWindowedSinc
                         WelchWindowedSinc
                         HammingWindowedSinc
                         LanczosWindowedSinc
                         GenericLabel[<interpolator=Linear>]
          Several interpolation options are available in ITK. These have all been made 
          available. Currently the interpolator choice is only used to warp (and possibly 
          inverse warp) the final output image(s). 

     -g, --restrict-deformation PxQxR
          This option allows the user to restrict the optimization of the displacement 
          field, translation, rigid or affine transform on a per-component basis. For 
          example, if one wants to limit the deformation or rotation of 3-D volume to the 
          first two dimensions, this is possible by specifying a weight vector of '1x1x0' 
          for a deformation field or '1x1x0x1x1x0' for a rigid transformation. 
          Low-dimensional restriction only works if there are no preceding 
          transformations.All stages up to and including the desired stage must have this 
          option specified,even if they should not be restricted (in which case specify 
          1x1x1...) 

     -q, --initial-fixed-transform initialTransform
                                   [initialTransform,<useInverse>]
                                   [fixedImage,movingImage,initializationFeature]
          Specify the initial fixed transform(s) which get immediately incorporated into 
          the composite transform. The order of the transforms is stack-esque in that the 
          last transform specified on the command line is the first to be applied. In 
          addition to initialization with ITK transforms, the user can perform an initial 
          translation alignment by specifying the fixed and moving images and selecting an 
          initialization feature. These features include using the geometric center of the 
          images (=0), the image intensities (=1), or the origin of the images (=2). 

     -r, --initial-moving-transform initialTransform
                                    [initialTransform,<useInverse>]
                                    [fixedImage,movingImage,initializationFeature]
          Specify the initial moving transform(s) which get immediately incorporated into 
          the composite transform. The order of the transforms is stack-esque in that the 
          last transform specified on the command line is the first to be applied. In 
          addition to initialization with ITK transforms, the user can perform an initial 
          translation alignment by specifying the fixed and moving images and selecting an 
          initialization feature. These features include using the geometric center of the 
          images (=0), the image intensities (=1), or the origin of the images (=2). 

     -m, --metric CC[fixedImage,movingImage,metricWeight,radius,<samplingStrategy={None,Regular,Random}>,<samplingPercentage=[0,1]>,<useGradientFilter=false>]
                  MI[fixedImage,movingImage,metricWeight,numberOfBins,<samplingStrategy={None,Regular,Random}>,<samplingPercentage=[0,1]>,<useGradientFilter=false>]
                  Mattes[fixedImage,movingImage,metricWeight,numberOfBins,<samplingStrategy={None,Regular,Random}>,<samplingPercentage=[0,1]>,<useGradientFilter=false>]

                  JHCT[fixedPointSet,movingPointSet,metricWeight,<samplingPercentage=[0,1]>,<boundaryPointsOnly=0>,<pointSetSigma=1>,<kNeighborhood=50>,<alpha=1.1>,<useAnisotropicCovariances=1>]
                  IGDM[fixedImage,movingImage,metricWeight,fixedMask,movingMask,<neighborhoodRadius=0x0>,<intensitySigma=0>,<distanceSigma=0>,<kNeighborhood=1>,<gradientSigma=1>]
          These image metrics are available--- CC: ANTS neighborhood cross correlation, 
          MI: Mutual information, Demons: (Thirion), MeanSquares, and GC: Global 
          Correlation. The "metricWeight" variable is used to modulate the per stage 
          weighting of the metrics. The metrics can also employ a sampling strategy 
          defined by a sampling percentage. The sampling strategy defaults to 'None' (aka 
          a dense sampling of one sample per voxel), otherwise it defines a point set over 
          which to optimize the metric. The point set can be on a regular lattice or a 
          random lattice of points slightly perturbed to minimize aliasing artifacts. 
          samplingPercentage defines the fraction of points to select from the domain. 
          useGradientFilter specifies whether a smoothingfilter is applied when estimating 
          the metric gradient.In addition, three point set metrics are available: 
          Euclidean (ICP), Point-set expectation (PSE), and Jensen-Havrda-Charvet-Tsallis 
          (JHCT). 

     -t, --transform Rigid[gradientStep]
                     Affine[gradientStep]
                     CompositeAffine[gradientStep]
                     Similarity[gradientStep]

                     TimeVaryingVelocityField[gradientStep,numberOfTimeIndices,updateFieldVarianceInVoxelSpace,updateFieldTimeVariance,totalFieldVarianceInVoxelSpace,totalFieldTimeVariance]
                     TimeVaryingBSplineVelocityField[gradientStep,velocityFieldMeshSize,<numberOfTimePointSamples=4>,<splineOrder=3>]
                     SyN[gradientStep,<updateFieldVarianceInVoxelSpace=3>,<totalFieldVarianceInVoxelSpace=0>]
                     BSplineSyN[gradientStep,updateFieldMeshSizeAtBaseLevel,<totalFieldMeshSizeAtBaseLevel=0>,<splineOrder=3>]
                     Exponential[gradientStep,updateFieldVarianceInVoxelSpace,velocityFieldVarianceInVoxelSpace,<numberOfIntegrationSteps>]
                     BSplineExponential[gradientStep,updateFieldMeshSizeAtBaseLevel,<velocityFieldMeshSizeAtBaseLevel=0>,<numberOfIntegrationSteps>,<splineOrder=3>]
          Several transform options are available. The gradientStep or learningRate 
          characterizes the gradient descent optimization and is scaled appropriately for 
          each transform using the shift scales estimator. Subsequent parameters are 
          transform-specific and can be determined from the usage. For the B-spline 
          transforms one can also specify the smoothing in terms of spline distance (i.e. 
          knot spacing). 

     -c, --convergence MxNxO
                       [MxNxO,<convergenceThreshold=1e-6>,<convergenceWindowSize=10>]
          Convergence is determined from the number of iterations per level and is 
          determined by fitting a line to the normalized energy profile of the last N 
          iterations (where N is specified by the window size) and determining the slope 
          which is then compared with the convergence threshold. 

     -s, --smoothing-sigmas MxNxO...
          Specify the sigma of gaussian smoothing at each level. Units are given in terms 
          of voxels ('vox') or physical spacing ('mm'). Example usage is '4x2x1mm' and 
          '4x2x1vox' where no units implies voxel spacing. 

     -f, --shrink-factors MxNxO...
          Specify the shrink factor for the virtual domain (typically the fixed image) at 
          each level. 

     -u, --use-histogram-matching 
          Histogram match the images before registration. 

     -w, --winsorize-image-intensities [lowerQuantile,upperQuantile]
          Winsorize data based on specified quantiles. 

     -x, --masks [fixedImageMask,movingImageMask]
          Image masks to limit voxels considered by the metric. Two options are allowed 
          for mask specification: 1) Either the user specifies a single mask to be used 
          for all stages or 2) the user specifies a mask for each stage. With the latter 
          one can select to which stages masks are applied by supplying valid file names. 
          If the file does not exist, a mask will not be used for that stage. Note that we 
          handle the fixed and moving masks separately to enforce this constraint. 

     --float 
          Use 'float' instead of 'double' for computations. 

     --minc 
          Use MINC file formats for transformations. 
          <VALUES>: 0

     --random-seed seedValue
          Use a fixed seed for random number generation. By default, the system clock is 
          used to initialize the seeding. The fixed seed can be any nonzero int value. 

     -v, --verbose (0)/1
          Verbose output. 

     -h 
          Print the help menu (short version). 

     --help 
          Print the help menu. Will also print values used on the current command line 
          call.
